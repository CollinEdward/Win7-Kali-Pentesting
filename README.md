6.2. Scanning for Vulnerabilities:

    Launch a terminal in the Kali Linux VM.

6.2.1. Port Scanning:

    Use the "nmap" command with the "-p-" option to perform a comprehensive port scan on the Windows 7 machine:

    nmap -p- <LHOST>

    This command scans all ports on the specified LHOST IP address and displays open ports.

6.2.2. Service and Version Enumeration:

    Perform service and version enumeration using the "nmap" command with the "-sV" option:

    nmap -sV <LHOST>

    This command detects the services running on open ports and attempts to determine their versions.

6.2.3. Operating System (OS) Detection:

    Determine the operating system running on the target machine with the "nmap" command and the "-O" option:

    nmap -O <LHOST>

    This command analyzes various network characteristics to identify the operating system of the target.

6.2.4. Vulnerability Scanning:

    Utilize the "nmap" command with the "--script vuln" option to scan for known vulnerabilities:

    nmap --script vuln <LHOST>

    This command leverages Nmap's vulnerability scripts to identify potential vulnerabilities on the target machine.

6.2.5. Comprehensive Scanning:

    Combine the above techniques for a comprehensive vulnerability assessment. Use the following command:

    nmap -p- -sV -O --script vuln <LHOST>

    This command performs port scanning, service/version enumeration, OS detection, and vulnerability scanning in a single scan.

Note: Vulnerability scanning may require elevated privileges, so ensure that you have appropriate permissions and legal authorization before performing any tests.

6.3. Analyzing the Scan Results:
